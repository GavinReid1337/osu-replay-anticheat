# osu-replay-anticheat
ORA is a tool developed to detect osu! cheats using replays.

## What it detects
Aimbot/Aim Assist - Detects these by checking for cursor teleports, cursor speed consistency, how close the cursor is to the center of a circle, patterns, etc.

Relax - Detects this by checking the unstable rate and checking tapping consistency.

Difficulty Changer (CS, HP, and OD) - Detects these by verifying that the player actually hit the notes.

Replay Copier - Detects this by comparing 2 replays.

Timewarp - Detects this by checking the average frame time.
